A monorepo is a technique where the code of multiple separate projects are hosted
in the same source-control repository. Popularized by silicon valley companies like
Google or Facebook, this differs from the obvious approach of giving every project
its own repo. Monorepos have a lot of surprising benefits if used correctly, but there
are a lot of intricacies in how monorepos work, and challenges to overcome to use them
well. This article will dive into these details, to set you up for success in case you
are considering adopting a monorepo code layout yourself in future.

## What is and isn't a Monorepo

At its simplest, a monorepo involves taking all the code in your organization, and
putting them in a single source-control repository: these days most commonly a Git
repository hosted on Github. This may include the code for multiple backend services,
frontend webapps, mobile apps on iOS and Android, data processing jobs, and other things.
This is contrast to traditional practices, where you often have "one repo per app"
or "one repo per service", resulting in dozens to over a hundred separate source control
repositories for any engineering organization of significant size.

Notably, a monorepo does not mean that all your code is:

1. Owned by a single team
2. Tested a single unit
3. Deployed in a single binary

The "monorepo" code organization is orthogonal to how your code is owned, tested, and
deployed. There are many codebases split out over multiple repos that are owned, tested,
and deployed as singular monoliths. Conversely, there are also many monorepos made of
independent modules that have separate ownership, selectively tested, and are deployed
to different microservices and applications.

## Benefits of using a Monorepo


### Easy Code Sharing


### Single Version History

### Atomic Changes

### Easy End-To-End Testing

## Challenges of using a Monorepo

### No Access Control

### Build & Test Performance

### Code Ownership

### Cross-Language Tooling
